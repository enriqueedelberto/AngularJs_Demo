# `angular-seed with Material and boostratp` â€” the seed for AngularJS apps

This project is base on https://github.com/angular/angular-seed.git , it contains the initial skeleton, and I added Angular Material(js and css).

I will add more things that help you start a web app angularJs at ease.

At first, you just clone o download the project from the repository, and after that:

Runs `npm install`  to install all of dependencies.

And secondly, you should type `npm start`
